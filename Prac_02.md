<h1>Learning Activities & Resources</h1>
I attempted to use the demo video found in the subject materials to gain a base understanding of how to meet the task requirements
and inform my later efforts. This however did not prove useful as I found that the information presented in the video was outdated.
The specific software recommended in the video (scotchbox) did not seem to have a functioning website and as such the content was not useful
due to it building off of and heavily utilising scotchbox.

I used the following article to familiarize myself with vagrant and the methods required by running through a demo of the software being used in action.

I followed the video tutorials from cloudaccess as a means of learning the user interface and how the software interacts with joomla

<h1>Estimated Hours</h1>

Approximately 6.5 hours


<h1>Content Insights</h1>
I felt that I had spent more time than necessary attempting to follow the methods presented in the subject demo video which lead to having little time to attempt to learn other methods.
This made me consider the necessity of diversifying my learning materials and not to put too much effort into pursuing something even if it is through an offical source and
that it is better to fully identify a useful source before investing considerable amounts of time into it.

<h1>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h1>
I felt that we had been given an inadequate amount of information to be able to complete this task effectively. This, while
not ideal did allow me to practice working in scenarios in which I am dealing with a very low amount of information for the required tasks
and to be able to better improvise when the immediate solution is not available.
