<h1>Week 04</h1>



<h1>Learning Activities & Resources</h1>
I read through the feedback given for my other journal entries to better understand how to improve. To fully process the feedback
I wrote my own personal critique of the feedback given to identify which points take priority for improvement.
I attended the practical session and watched the demo given for docker using AWS. I watched the demo provided through
the lecture videos on using Vagrant.

I used a written guide on using docker to locally host wordpress sites to assist in conducting the practical tasks.

<h1>Estimated Hours</h1>

Approximately 4.5 hours


<h1>Content Insights</h1>

Despite having learnt the basics of vagrant in a prior week I felt it would be better to first follow the docker demo provided as a means of sampling both docker and ensuring I can get a 
functional local development environment set up before experimenting with different methods. 
I did this so that if I spent a long period of time using vagrant without success that I would still have a product to be able to showcase as having completed the assigned tasks.
I ultimately did not end up using either method exactly as shown in the demos as my needs were met by not using AWS.

<h1>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h1>
I observed during the practical session that the use of generative AI to create a set of instructions in the demo impeded progress by providing misleading and inconsistent information. 
I noted that the effort that had to be expended fixing the issues present in the instructions provided was greater than the amount of effort it would require to find a human written and verified set of instructions appropriate to the needs of the user. 
This made me consider how I could alter some of the substandard methods I had been employing in my work. One such method
I changed with this mindset was to switch from using a document editor for note taking to a dedicated note program which 
had immediate noticeable beneficial impacts on my productivity due to the software's design being more conducive to taking lots of notes in an organised manner
