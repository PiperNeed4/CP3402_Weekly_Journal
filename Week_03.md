<h1>Learning Activities & Resources</h1>

I attended the weekly practical and participated in the interview process for potential team members for the group assignment.

I watched the linkedin series about using wordpress to gain familiarity with the wordpress systems. I followed along through
each of the videos as they demonstrated how each feature to gain firsthand knowledge of how best to use them.

<h1>Estimated Hours</h1>

Approximately 6 hours


<h1>Content Insights</h1>
I found that by only having planned the questions ahead of time I had failed to consider the process of how to 
interview everyone in an efficient manner for both myself and others. Because of this I have now been making sure to consider
all aspects of a task before starting work as a means of ensuring every need is being met and no time is being wasted on work that is not relevant.

Over the course of completing the assigned tasks I have come to prefer Wordpress to Joomla as I believe its features and design
to be overall of a higher quality than Joomla. I did return to Joomla after using Wordpress to attempt to reevaluate my opinions of
the service to gain a better understanding of which I would prefer to use in a workplace environment. While after the experience
I still prefer Wordpress for general website creation I have since come to view Joomla more positively as a lot of my issues
with the software were due to my inexperience with content management systems and how they function.

<h1>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h1>

I made my interview questions knowing what kind of answers I would be the most impressed by and structured my questions
to prompt the kind of answers I wanted but not to make the best answer obvious. By having experience on the other
side of the interview process and experiencing what goes into writing questions and conducting the interview, I
now believe that when being interviewed in the future I should be able to better discern interviewer intent behind the questions
being asked and be able to provide the answers they want from a candidate.

I opted to host my wordpress site online as I know that hosting a site locally is a requirement for next week
and I wanted to fully explore both methods as a means of becoming proficient with a greater number of methods.
I found it important that I gain the knowledge to do it both ways as it is likely that a work environment would necessitate
the use of both in certain contexts.
