<h1>Week 01</h1>

<h1>Learning Activities & Resources</h1>

I familiarized myself with the expectations and requirements of the subject by reading the materials and watching the lecture videos. After going through the review materials provided in the lecture, I felt my knowledge had diminished somewhat since last having to use HTML and CSS and as such revised the basics of coding in HTML and CSS using a mixture of old subject material and resources found online. I used the Github pages quick start guide to learn how to publish the site. I reviewed the example start ups found in the assignment document.


<h1>Estimated Hours</h1>

Approximately 4 hours


<h1>Content Insights</h1>

The revision materials helped me re-learn proper syntax in HTML and the proper use of classes in CSS. The example start ups helped me understand the specifics behind what makes a business unique and assisted in brainstorming for my idea for this practical.



<h1>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h1>

As I had already used Visual Studio code in prior subjects I opted to use Phpstorm so that I can familiarize myself with it in a learning environment. This was done both to learn it in case it is the software of choice in a work environment and to get a better sense of what I might find preferable in an IDE. Additionally by familiarizing myself with a brand new IDE I am training myself to be more adaptable in the methods I use to complete a task, thus allowing me to better use any new software or technology needed in the workplace. Due to circumstances out of my control I was unable to attend the practical session for this week, because of this my work and learning suffered due to not having the knowledge necessary to complete the tasks to the best of my ability. This setback has made me realize the importance of having contingency plans to prevent unexpected events from negatively impacting my progress.
