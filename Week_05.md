I have found over the course of the past few weeks that I had fallen into the bad habit of
overcomplicating otherwise simple tasks. This resulted in me spending a significant amount of time into pursuing methods
of accomplishing tasks which ultimately did not pan out. This has lead me to adopt a new method of approaching problems
in which I first try to ascertain what the simplest and easiest method of accomplishing the task is before proceeding. While
often times the simplest method isn't the best it allows me to get a minimum viable product that can then be improved upon further. 
This should prove useful in the workplace and my future studies as it enables me to have a product ready before deadlines consistently.
This method also allows me to gain experience in the field at a quicker rate than just reading documentation.
